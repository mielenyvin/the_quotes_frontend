Now as the panic subsides, some scientists are saying the new variant doesn’t look so bad.\n\nVaccines seem to be effective against the new variant, GlaxoSmithKline and the World Health Organization found, and scientists around the world reiterated that there is no evidence the Omicron variant is more deadly than previous strains.\n\n“Currently, there is no reason for panicking, as we don’t see severely ill patients,” Dr. Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, told the Telegraph.\n\n**Drugs and vaccines**\n\nDrugmaker GlaxoSmithKline reported Thursday that in early testing, COVID-19 antibody treatments were effective against new mutations found in the variant, and that GSK was now conducting in vitro testing to confirm this further.\n\nMeanwhile the WHO, which labeled Omicron a “mutation variant of serious concern” last Friday, has now said that vaccines are likely to protect against severe cases. “We still need to find out if there’s any loss of protection, but we think vaccines will still protect against severe disease as they have against the other variants,” WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said.\n\nAustralia’s Chief Medical Officer, Paul Kelly, also said in a recorded message that there wasn’t any indication that the Omicron variant was more deadly than other strains: “Of the over 300 cases that have now been diagnosed in many countries, they have all been very mild or in fact had no symptoms at all.”\n\nThese optimistic claims build upon other recent statements from drugmakers and scientists who have expressed confidence that antiviral drugs will prove effective in combating the variant.\n\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla told CNBC this week that he has a “very high level of confidence” that Pfizer’s antiviral pill “will not be affected by this [Omicron] virus,” while Merck noted that its molnupiravir antiviral pill should perform similarly against Omicron as against other existing variants.\n\n**Buy the dip**\n\nIn the face of positive news coming from the medical and scientific community, the Omicron-caused market downturn offers an opportunity for investors to “buy the dip,” JPMorgan Chase advised, with a possible V-shaped recovery enabling investors to position themselves for the reopening and commodity trades.  \n\n“We view the recent selloff in these segments as an opportunity to buy the dip in cyclicals, commodities and reopening themes, and to position for higher bond yields and steepening,” bank strategists said in a note.\n\nThe JPMorgan strategists expressed optimism that Omicron would follow the historical pattern of viruses where less severe and more transmissible viruses crowd out severe variants, eventually making the disease more akin to a seasonal flu than a deadly pandemic.\n\n“If that scenario were to happen, instead of skipping two letters and naming it Omicron, the WHO could have skipped all the way to Omega [the last letter of the Greek alphabet],” the strategists said.\n\nSince it was first detected in South Africa, the Omicron variant has been found in 24 countries, leading many nations in the Global North to impose travel bans or other curbs to delay the variant from entering their borders. On Friday, the day the WHO named Omicron and classified it as a “variant of concern,” bourses around the globe fell—and have yet to fully recover.","Media2_text":"The omicron coronavirus variant is one of pure concern, according to Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n\nWhat is the omicron variant?\nOver the holiday weekend, researchers in South Africa sounded the alarm on a new coronavirus variant that had been spreading in parts of Africa, as I wrote for the Deseret News.\n\nThe variant reportedly had dozens of mutations that worried experts, who said the variant could potentially evade vaccines and be resistant to antibodies.\nThe World Health Organization designed the variant to be called “omicron,” based on the letter in the Greek alphabet.\n\nWhy is the omicron variant so dangerous?\nSchaffner, the expert from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told WTVF-TV that the variant has a series of mutations that will make it more troubling for the current COVID-19 vaccines and antibodies.\n\n“This omicron variant has accumulated a whole series of mutations that involve that critical aspect of the virus,” Schaffner said. “The thing that we call the spike protein. Think of the virus as a little ball with spikes sticking out. That spike protein is what we’re talking about. That’s the key. When the virus hits our cells, it lets the key get into the lock. It lets the virus get into the cell, multiply and start producing the disease. What the vaccine does is glom onto that spike protein, so it can’t get into our cells and therefore we’re protected. Can this new spike protein, on the omicron variant, evade the protections of our vaccines?”\nSchaffner said he knows everyone is sick of COVID-19 and the pandemic. But, he said, hopefully, people will understand that the new variant shouldn’t be ignored and people will take proper precautions to stay safe.\n\n“We’re going to be dealing with COVID in one form or another going forward. I’m afraid that’s the sad reality,” he told WTVF-TV.\n\nHow to stay safe from omicron variant\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged all fully vaccinated Americans to get their COVID-19 boosters to help themselves stay safe from the new variant.\n\n“Today, CDC is strengthening its recommendation on booster doses for individuals who are 18 years and older,” said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC director, in a statement. “Everyone ages 18 and older should get a booster shot either when they are six months after their initial Pfizer or Moderna series or 2 months after their initial J&J vaccine.”","reference1":"https://www.deseret.com/coronavirus/2021/11/30/22809801/omicron-variant-dangerous-explain-spike-protein-infection","reference2":"https://fortune.com/2021/12/02/gsk-who-jpmorgan-scientists-omicron-more-dangerous-other-covid-19-variants/","short_description":"Short

A first or second jab is of much greater benefit than a third one, protecting against serious illness, mortality and further transmission. Those outside the rich world are not being protected because of scarcity of supply. Their first or second jabs must have priority over our third.\n\nPoliticians may find this policy difficult, fearing critics who might accuse them of giving “our” benefit to foreigners. There is a simple solution. We should decline this third immunisation. I, a healthy pensioner who has had two doses, have refused the third jab, asking for it to be sent to those who will benefit more, and I invite others to do the same. This is not simply altruistic; limiting the extent of the pandemic is an advantage to all of us.\n\nChristopher Cheetham\nYatton, Somerset","Media2_text":"In response to Christopher Cheetham’s letter (21 September), I do not wish to disparage his sentiment of promoting the international availability of vaccines, but I must disagree with his proposed action. Refusing a Covid booster in the UK is not the way to increase the availability of vaccines in the world. Such action will only lead to wasted doses. Furthermore, an undervaccinated population will put an increasing strain on the NHS, and places our physically nearest and dearest at greater risk. Greater production of vaccines and their coordinated distribution internationally has to be a better answer.\n\nDr Stephen Mullin\nConsultant clinical neuropsychologist\n\n Declining a booster could lead to vaccines being wasted rather than sent overseas. I, and many others, would be happy to donate our boosters if tests showed we didn’t need it, according to research by Imperial College. Without this, my inclination is to have the booster to protect my own and others’ health, and reduce the demands on the NHS. Instead, people could donate to one of the organisations involved in Covax (for example, Unicef or Vaccinaid) and campaign for the government to do more. The petition here might be a start: .\n\nMarilyn Howard\nGloucester\n\n What about those of us who are extremely vulnerable? I still won’t leave the house alone except for medical appointments due to anxiety about contracting Covid. Although I have had both injections, I have been told I may not survive if I do contract it. So I will be accepting my booster, as some protection is better than none. I do not feel I am being selfish for trying to keep myself alive.\n\nTina Foster\nShipley, West

Kosovo.\n\n“We support your position on the Kosovo settlement, and I hope that the situation will eventually evolve in a way that would conform to the interests of all people living in the region,” he said.\n\nKosovo was a Serb province until a 1998-1999 insurrection by ethnic Albanian rebels sparked a bloody Serbian crackdown. That pushed NATO to carry out a 78-day bombing campaign to force Serbian troops out of Kosovo. The war left more than 10,000 people dead. Kosovo declared independence in 2008, but Serbia hasn’t recognized it. Kosovo-Serbia ties remain tense despite a European Union-facilitated dialogue over the past decade to normalize them.\n\nVucic hailed close ties between Serbia and Russia and particularly noted a high level in defense cooperation.\n\nAlthough formally seeking EU membership, Serbia has refused to align its foreign policies with the 27-nation bloc and has instead strengthened its alliance with Russia and China.","Media2_text":"Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić had a very unpleasant task when he met his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Sochi last week to plea for a lower price for Russian gas.\n\nIndeed, before travelling to Russia, President Vučić had told the Serbian press that he would \"ask and beg.\"\n\nIn the end, Putin fulfilled the request of his Serbian guest, meaning the Serbian president will have one less problem to worry about ahead of the April 2022 Serbian general election.\n\nHowever, the question remains as to whether there will be a price to be paid.\n\n**Serbia's gas supply on the line**\n\nWhy was this an unpleasant task for Vučić? Serbia is completely dependent on Russia for its gas supplies.\n\nIn 2008, Russia acquired majority shares in NIS, Serbia’s national oil and gas company. The sale was made below market price, in return for Russia’s protection at the UN level on Kosovo and the promise that Moscow would construct the now-defunct South Stream pipeline over Serbian territory. The opening of the Turkstream pipeline in 2021 confirmed the reality of energy dependence.\n\nHowever, in light of the ongoing energy crisis in Europe, Serbia now fears high Russian gas prices.\n\nIn 2022, Serbia is poised to undergo presidential and parliamentary elections, as well as elections in the capital, Belgrade.\n\nPresident Vučić and his Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) are almost certain to win. But both still face the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economy, which must not experience a major downturn until after they consolidate power.\n\nThe Serbian leadership needs to show that despite the pandemic, the economy is still growing. That was the primary reason why the government enthusiastically embraced Chinese financing, despite the ensuing degradation of environmental and labour standards.\n\nThe UAE is also useful as a source of cash and an instrument of domestic promotion. However, the high gas price would complicate things.\n\nThe first reason for Vučić’s concern was more immediate: the start of the cold season. High gas prices lead to higher costs for heating, electricity and groceries: all the things voters observe in the run-up to elections. In mid-November, high food and energy prices pushed the inflation rate to 6.6 per cent.\n\nSerbian pro-government daily Večernje novosti, despite being known for uncritical and hyperbolic praise of Serbian leadership and Serbo-Russian ties, gave an accurate overview of Serbia’s concern ahead of the Putin-Vučić meeting.\n\nSerbian gas consumption has doubled compared to previous years. Serbia has been paying Russia $270 (€239) per 1,000 cubic meters because, since the Soviet days, Serbia bought Russian gas based on a system whereby 100 per cent of the pricing is derived from the oil formula.\n\nIn light of the energy crisis, Russia’s state-owned energy corporation Gazprom proposed that price be determined 30 per cent by oil formula, 70 per cent by spot market prices, which would see Serbia newly charged $790 (€698) per 1,000 cubic meters.\n\n**Not such an easy task**\n\nThe Serbian head of state was hoping to secure a new arrangement, in which Serbia would be buying three billion cubic meters of Russian natural gas annually for ten years.\n\nPro-government media in Serbia flaunted the notion that Vučić could secure a fairer Russian gas price than countries like Germany, Belarus and Armenia had.\n\nThe difference was that Germany is a major customer of Russian gas, with a long-term supply contract, and Belarus and Armenia are Russia’s allies in the post-Soviet space.\n\nMore importantly, while Serbia insisted the focus would be on gas supply, Russia's presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that the two leaders would be discussing bilateral ties, with energy being just one of the issues that would be addressed.\n\nWhy is this important? For the past year, Serbia did a slight re-pivot towards Russia due to the election of Joe Biden in the US. However, 2020 was a very bad year for Serbo-Russian ties. Putin did not forget that.\n\nWhat happened in 2020? Putin did not like the idea that Vučić was trying to resolve the Kosovo dispute with Donald Trump’s assistance, which would mean Moscow would lose one of its last assets in the Balkans, and Belgrade's shifting towards Washington.\n\nTo curry favour with the West, pro-government tabloids in Serbia blamed pro-Russian players for instigating violent anti-lockdown protests in the summer of 2020.\n\nTrilateral military drills with Russia and Belarus were also cancelled. In the meantime, China replaced Russia as Serbia’s primary non-Western partner.\n\nPutin did not forget how Vučić tried to trick him when he thought he would get a better bargain from the West. The meeting was almost certainly used to discipline Vučić.\n\nNevertheless, Vučić got what he wanted. After the meeting, it was announced that the gas price for Serbia would remain at $270 and the amount of delivered gas would increase for the next six months.\n\nNo one knows what will happen after those six months end. But Vučić got a gift from Putin for the heating season -- and for the elections. Vučić can also promote himself to his constituents as a skillful leader who enjoys the friendship of brotherly Russia.\n\nWhat were the concessions offered?\nIt should be presumed, though, that Putin’s gift comes with strings attached.\n\nOn that same day, news started circulating that Russia’s state nuclear construction company Rosatom could be constructing a nuclear power plant in Serbia, although Serbian experts don't believe Serbia has the necessary expertise or resources for such an enterprise.\n\nRussian companies are also set to get the job of constructing the Belgrade urban and suburban railway system.\n\nMost importantly, there are talks that Serbia might be getting Kornet anti-tank missile systems from Russia: a dangerous scenario since in late 2019, Serbia, in fear of US sanctions, gave up on purchasing Russian weaponry.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether these transactions will be completed, and indeed whether any other favours that Vučić promised to Putin will be uncovered later in the game. After all, there's no such thing as a free lunch.","reference1":"https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/putin-russia-offer-good-gas-deal-serbia-81394127","reference2":"https://www.euronews.com/2021/12/04/russia-s-gas-gift-to-serbia-comes-with-strings-attached-view","short_description":"Short

France-Presse","Media1_text":"The World Health Organization has warned blanket travel bans will not prevent the spread of Omicron, as more countries rushed to impose curbs and the first cases of the new Covid strain were detected in Latin America.\n\nIn the week since the new virus strain was reported by South Africa, dozens of countries around the world have responded with travel restrictions -- most targeting southern African nations.\n\nBut the World Health Organization warned Tuesday that \"blanket\" travel bans risked doing more harm than good, just as Canada expanded its restrictions.\n\nIn a travel advisory, the WHO warned the bans could ultimately dissuade countries from sharing data about the evolving virus.\n\nBut it did advise that unvaccinated people vulnerable to Covid-19, including over-60s, should avoid travel to areas with community transmission of the virus.\n\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was understandable for countries to seek to protect their citizens \"against a variant we don't yet fully understand\".\n\nBut he called for the global response to be \"calm, coordinated and coherent\", urging nations to \"take rational, proportional risk-reduction measures\".\n\nThe likely futility of broad travel restrictions was underscored as Dutch authorities reported that Omicron was present in the country before South Africa officially reported its first cases on November 25.\n\nThe new variant -- whose high number of mutations the WHO believes may make it more transmissible or resistant to vaccines -- was found in two Dutch test samples from November 19 and 23, with one having no travel history.\n\nSo far, well over a dozen countries and territories have detected cases, including Australia, Britain, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy and Portugal.\n\nLatin America reported its first two cases Tuesday -- in people who travelled from South Africa to Brazil -- and a first case was confirmed in Japan, one day after it barred all foreign arrivals.\n\nHowever, US President Joe Biden said the travel bans on just the southern African nations would stay in place, without referencing the other places where Omicron has been detected.\n\nAsked how long travel restrictions that took effect Monday on South Africa and seven other southern African countries would remain, Biden said it \"kind of depends\".\n\n\"We're going to learn a lot more in the next couple weeks about the lethality of this virus, about how much it spreads, what we have to control it, etcetera,\" he told reporters.\n\nAsked if any expansion of the travel restrictions to other countries could be made suddenly, as happened under former president Donald Trump, Biden said: \"Unlike Trump I don't shock our allies.\"\n\nIn Asia, governments continued Wednesday to expand restrictions, including with Indonesia adding Hong Kong to its travel ban list alongside various African nations.\n\nHong Kong also added three more countries – Japan, Portugal and Sweden -- to its highest travel restriction category after Omicron cases were discovered in those nations.\n\nVaccine-resistant? While much is still unknown about the Omicron variant -- it could take weeks to determine whether and to what extent it is vaccine-resistant -- it has highlighted that the global fight against Covid-19 is far from over.\n\nOmicron has emerged as much of the northern hemisphere was already bracing for a new winter wave of the pandemic -- leaving even nations with high vaccination rates struggling to contain rising infection numbers and prevent health services from being overwhelmed.\n\nGovernments, particularly in Western Europe, have already reintroduced mandatory mask-wearing, social-distancing measures, curfews or lockdowns -- leaving businesses fearing another grim Christmas.\n\nBritain has set a target of delivering third jabs to all adults within two months.\n\nWhile the European summer of fleeting Covid freedoms may be over, in the southern hemisphere, the Pacific island of Fiji ended 615 days of international isolation on Wednesday and reopened to tourists.\n\nTraditional dancers in grass skirts welcomed waving holidaymakers from Sydney, the first of an expected flood of desperately needed tourists in the coming weeks.\n\nFiji Airways chief executive Andre Viljoen said it was a \"momentous\" occasion, where tourism accounts for about 40 percent of the economy.\n\n\"The international border reopening will reignite Fiji's economy,\" he told reporters.","Media2_text":"Days after the new COVID-19 variant omicron was identified in South Africa, ever more countries are moving to close their borders to stem its spread. What travel restrictions are in place and can they be effective?\n\nB.1.1.529 is the scientific name of the new coronavirus variant discovered last week in South Africa. It has since been detected in several other countries, with Germany, Portugal, Great Britain, Israel and Canada, for instance, all reporting omicron infections.\n\nThere are fears that the new mutant could be even more contagious than the currently rampant delta variant and that vaccines may be less effective against it. As a result, many countries are trying to stem the further spread of omicron with travel curbs.\n\n**Europe **\n\nSince last week, travel between many European countries and southern Africa has been restricted. In Germany, for example, authorities deemed South Africa and seven other countries in the region — Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mozambique, Eswatini, Malawi and Lesotho — high-risk areas where the omicron virus variant is circulating. Airlines are only allowed to fly back German citizens and those residing in Germany from there. Both unvaccinated and vaccinated travelers coming from the region have to spend 14 days in quarantine regardless of whether they test negative for COVID-19.\n\nThe UK has resumed flight connections to South Africa after a temporary halt because of the omicron variant. However, South Africa and several neighboring countries are on a so-called red list. That means passengers returning from these countries face mandatory hotel quarantine for 10 days at their own expense.\n\nSwitzerland, too, has significantly tightened travel restrictions. Regular flights from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe have been suspended indefinitely. In addition, people entering the country from southern Africa, as well as from Hong Kong, Israel, Belgium, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Egypt, Malawi and other countries have to show a negative Corona test and spend 10 days in quarantine.\n\nAmerica\n\nUS President Joe Biden is under no illusion that the new variant can be stopped at borders.\n\n\"Sooner or later we are going to see new cases of this new variant here in the United States and we're going to have to face this new threat just as we have faced the ones that came before it,\" Biden said. Nevertheless, the US has also blocked entry for foreign nationals from southern African states in order to at least slow the virus' spread.\n\nIn neighboring Canada, where the first Omicron cases have already been detected, the government has imposed new travel curbs regarding South Africa, Eswatini, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Namibia. Only Canadian citizens from those countries and people with permanent residency in Canada can currently enter the country. They also have to comply with testing and quarantine regulations.\n\nBrazil has imposed a ban on flights from six southern African countries. Mexico's government, on the other hand, has ruled out new restrictions and border closures due to the discovery of the omicron variant. There is \"no evidence\" that the mutant is more dangerous and that vaccines are less effective against it, authorities said.\n\nAsia\n\nSeveral countries in Asia have also moved to curb the spread of omicron. Japan in the east and and Israel in the west, have implemented some of the toughest measures, with both closing borders to all foreigners, regardless of where they're coming from. Israeli travelers, for instance, have to isolate themselves for at least three days upon entry into the country whether they are vaccinated or unvaccinated, and no matter where they are arriving from. In addition, Israel is reintroducing a controversial measure that involves monitoring the mobile phones of those who fall ill.\n\nThe Philippines, which depends heavily on tourism, also plans to suspend measures to ease entry for vaccinated tourists because of the new virus variant. South Korea and Thailand are restricting flights from eight countries from December and those who have already entered the country have to immediately quarantine.\n\nOceania\n\nCanberra planned to allow foreign visitors with Australian visas to enter the country again from December 1, after access was severely restricted since May last year. But plans to relax entry rules have now been postponed for two weeks.

Which countries have closed their borders?","media1_date":"2021-12-12","media2_date":"2021-11-30","media1_name":"France24","media2_name":"Deutsche Welle","Media1_text":"The World Health Organization has warned blanket travel bans will not prevent the spread of Omicron, as more countries rushed to impose curbs and the first cases of the new Covid strain were detected in Latin America.\n\nIn the week since the new virus strain was reported by South Africa, dozens of countries around the world have responded with travel restrictions -- most targeting southern African nations.\n\nBut the World Health Organization warned Tuesday that \"blanket\" travel bans risked doing more harm than good, just as Canada expanded its restrictions.\n\nIn a travel advisory, the WHO warned the bans could ultimately dissuade countries from sharing data about the evolving virus.\n\nBut it did advise that unvaccinated people vulnerable to Covid-19, including over-60s, should avoid travel to areas with community transmission of the virus.\n\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was understandable for countries to seek to protect their citizens \"against a variant we don't yet fully understand\".\n\nBut he called for the global response to be \"calm, coordinated and coherent\", urging nations to \"take rational, proportional risk-reduction measures\".\n\nThe likely futility of broad travel restrictions was underscored as Dutch authorities reported that Omicron was present in the country before South Africa officially reported its first cases on November 25.\n\nThe new variant -- whose high number of mutations the WHO believes may make it more transmissible or resistant to vaccines -- was found in two Dutch test samples from November 19 and 23, with one having no travel history.\n\nSo far, well over a dozen countries and territories have detected cases, including Australia, Britain, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy and Portugal.\n\nLatin America reported its first two cases Tuesday -- in people who travelled from South Africa to Brazil -- and a first case was confirmed in Japan, one day after it barred all foreign arrivals.\n\nHowever, US President Joe Biden said the travel bans on just the southern African nations would stay in place, without referencing the other places where Omicron has been detected.\n\nAsked how long travel restrictions that took effect Monday on South Africa and seven other southern African countries would remain, Biden said it \"kind of depends\".\n\n\"We're going to learn a lot more in the next couple weeks about the lethality of this virus, about how much it spreads, what we have to control it, etcetera,\" he told reporters.\n\nAsked if any expansion of the travel restrictions to other countries could be made suddenly, as happened under former president Donald Trump, Biden said: \"Unlike Trump I don't shock our allies.\"\n\nIn Asia, governments continued Wednesday to expand restrictions, including with Indonesia adding Hong Kong to its travel ban list alongside various African nations.\n\nHong Kong also added three more countries – Japan, Portugal and Sweden -- to its highest travel restriction category after Omicron cases were discovered in those nations.\n\n**Vaccine-resistant?**\nWhile much is still unknown about the Omicron variant -- it could take weeks to determine whether and to what extent it is vaccine-resistant -- it has highlighted that the global fight against Covid-19 is far from over.\n\nOmicron has emerged as much of the northern hemisphere was already bracing for a new winter wave of the pandemic -- leaving even nations with high vaccination rates struggling to contain rising infection numbers and prevent health services from being overwhelmed.\n\nGovernments, particularly in Western Europe, have already reintroduced mandatory mask-wearing, social-distancing measures, curfews or lockdowns -- leaving businesses fearing another grim Christmas.\n\nBritain has set a target of delivering third jabs to all adults within two months.\n\nWhile the European summer of fleeting Covid freedoms may be over, in the southern hemisphere, the Pacific island of Fiji ended 615 days of international isolation on Wednesday and reopened to tourists.\n\nTraditional dancers in grass skirts welcomed waving holidaymakers from Sydney, the first of an expected flood of desperately needed tourists in the coming weeks.\n\nFiji Airways chief executive Andre Viljoen said it was a \"momentous\" occasion, where tourism accounts for about 40 percent of the economy.\n\n\"The international border reopening will reignite Fiji's economy,\" he told reporters.","Media2_text":"Days after the new COVID-19 variant omicron was identified in South Africa, ever more countries are moving to close their borders to stem its spread. What travel restrictions are in place and can they be effective?\n\nB.1.1.529 is the scientific name of the new coronavirus variant discovered last week in South Africa. It has since been detected in several other countries, with Germany, Portugal, Great Britain, Israel and Canada, for instance, all reporting omicron infections.\n\nThere are fears that the new mutant could be even more contagious than the currently rampant delta variant and that vaccines may be less effective against it. As a result, many countries are trying to stem the further spread of omicron with travel curbs.\n\n**Europe **\n\nSince last week, travel between many European countries and southern Africa has been restricted. In Germany, for example, authorities deemed South Africa and seven other countries in the region — Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mozambique, Eswatini, Malawi and Lesotho — high-risk areas where the omicron virus variant is circulating. Airlines are only allowed to fly back German citizens and those residing in Germany from there. Both unvaccinated and vaccinated travelers coming from the region have to spend 14 days in quarantine regardless of whether they test negative for COVID-19.\n\nThe UK has resumed flight connections to South Africa after a temporary halt because of the omicron variant. However, South Africa and several neighboring countries are on a so-called red list. That means passengers returning from these countries face mandatory hotel quarantine for 10 days at their own expense.\n\nSwitzerland, too, has significantly tightened travel restrictions. Regular flights from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe have been suspended indefinitely. In addition, people entering the country from southern Africa, as well as from Hong Kong, Israel, Belgium, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Egypt, Malawi and other countries have to show a negative Corona test and spend 10 days in quarantine.\n\n**America**\n\nUS President Joe Biden is under no illusion that the new variant can be stopped at borders.\n\n\"Sooner or later we are going to see new cases of this new variant here in the United States and we're going to have to face this new threat just as we have faced the ones that came before it,\" Biden said. Nevertheless, the US has also blocked entry for foreign nationals from southern African states in order to at least slow the virus' spread.\n\nIn neighboring Canada, where the first Omicron cases have already been detected, the government has imposed new travel curbs regarding South Africa, Eswatini, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Namibia. Only Canadian citizens from those countries and people with permanent residency in Canada can currently enter the country. They also have to comply with testing and quarantine regulations.\n\nBrazil has imposed a ban on flights from six southern African countries. Mexico's government, on the other hand, has ruled out new restrictions and border closures due to the discovery of the omicron variant. There is \"no evidence\" that the mutant is more dangerous and that vaccines are less effective against it, authorities said.\n\n**Asia**\n\nSeveral countries in Asia have also moved to curb the spread of omicron. Japan in the east and and Israel in the west, have implemented some of the toughest measures, with both closing borders to all foreigners, regardless of where they're coming from. Israeli travelers, for instance, have to isolate themselves for at least three days upon entry into the country whether they are vaccinated or unvaccinated, and no matter where they are arriving from. In addition, Israel is reintroducing a controversial measure that involves monitoring the mobile phones of those who fall ill.\n\nThe Philippines, which depends heavily on tourism, also plans to suspend measures to ease entry for vaccinated tourists because of the new virus variant. South Korea and Thailand are restricting flights from eight countries from December and those who have already entered the country have to immediately quarantine.\n\n**Oceania**\n\nCanberra planned to allow foreign visitors with Australian visas to enter the country again from December 1, after access was severely restricted since May last year. But plans to relax entry rules have now been postponed for two weeks. The decision was made on the recommendation of health authorities after the first cases of omicron were also detected in Australia.\n\n**Africa**\n\nA number of African countries, including Angola, Egypt, Mauritius and Rwanda, have also joined the ranks of countries that have imposed travel restrictions on South Africa and other nations on the continent. South African officials described it as \"regrettable, even sad,\" adding that the decisions were \"unjustified because they are not based on scientific evidence.''","reference1":"https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20211201-who-warns-against-omicron-travel-bans-as-nations-shut-borders","reference2":"https://www.dw.com/en/omicron-which-countries-have-closed-their-borders/a-59979182","short_description":"Short

Now as the panic subsides, some scientists are saying the new variant doesn’t look so bad.\n\nVaccines seem to be effective against the new variant, GlaxoSmithKline and the World Health Organization found, and scientists around the world reiterated that there is no evidence the Omicron variant is more deadly than previous strains.\n\n“Currently, there is no reason for panicking, as we don’t see severely ill patients,” Dr. Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, told the Telegraph.\n\n**Drugs and vaccines**\n\nDrugmaker GlaxoSmithKline reported Thursday that in early testing, COVID-19 antibody treatments were effective against new mutations found in the variant, and that GSK was now conducting in vitro testing to confirm this further.\n\nMeanwhile the WHO, which labeled Omicron a “mutation variant of serious concern” last Friday, has now said that vaccines are likely to protect against severe cases. “We still need to find out if there’s any loss of protection, but we think vaccines will still protect against severe disease as they have against the other variants,” WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said.\n\nAustralia’s Chief Medical Officer, Paul Kelly, also said in a recorded message that there wasn’t any indication that the Omicron variant was more deadly than other strains: “Of the over 300 cases that have now been diagnosed in many countries, they have all been very mild or in fact had no symptoms at all.”\n\nThese optimistic claims build upon other recent statements from drugmakers and scientists who have expressed confidence that antiviral drugs will prove effective in combating the variant.\n\nPfizer CEO Albert Bourla told CNBC this week that he has a “very high level of confidence” that Pfizer’s antiviral pill “will not be affected by this [Omicron] virus,” while Merck noted that its molnupiravir antiviral pill should perform similarly against Omicron as against other existing variants.\n\n**Buy the dip**\n\nIn the face of positive news coming from the medical and scientific community, the Omicron-caused market downturn offers an opportunity for investors to “buy the dip,” JPMorgan Chase advised, with a possible V-shaped recovery enabling investors to position themselves for the reopening and commodity trades.  \n\n“We view the recent selloff in these segments as an opportunity to buy the dip in cyclicals, commodities and reopening themes, and to position for higher bond yields and steepening,” bank strategists said in a note.\n\nThe JPMorgan strategists expressed optimism that Omicron would follow the historical pattern of viruses where less severe and more transmissible viruses crowd out severe variants, eventually making the disease more akin to a seasonal flu than a deadly pandemic.\n\n“If that scenario were to happen, instead of skipping two letters and naming it Omicron, the WHO could have skipped all the way to Omega [the last letter of the Greek alphabet],” the strategists said.\n\nSince it was first detected in South Africa, the Omicron variant has been found in 24 countries, leading many nations in the Global North to impose travel bans or other curbs to delay the variant from entering their borders. On Friday, the day the WHO named Omicron and classified it as a “variant of concern,” bourses around the globe fell—and have yet to fully recover.","Media2_text":"The omicron coronavirus variant is one of pure concern, according to Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\n\nWhat is the omicron variant?\nOver the holiday weekend, researchers in South Africa sounded the alarm on a new coronavirus variant that had been spreading in parts of Africa, as I wrote for the Deseret News.\n\nThe variant reportedly had dozens of mutations that worried experts, who said the variant could potentially evade vaccines and be resistant to antibodies.\nThe World Health Organization designed the variant to be called “omicron,” based on the letter in the Greek alphabet.\n\nWhy is the omicron variant so dangerous?\nSchaffner, the expert from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told WTVF-TV that the variant has a series of mutations that will make it more troubling for the current COVID-19 vaccines and antibodies.\n\n“This omicron variant has accumulated a whole series of mutations that involve that critical aspect of the virus,” Schaffner said. “The thing that we call the spike protein. Think of the virus as a little ball with spikes sticking out. That spike protein is what we’re talking about. That’s the key. When the virus hits our cells, it lets the key get into the lock. It lets the virus get into the cell, multiply and start producing the disease. What the vaccine does is glom onto that spike protein, so it can’t get into our cells and therefore we’re protected. Can this new spike protein, on the omicron variant, evade the protections of our vaccines?”\nSchaffner said he knows everyone is sick of COVID-19 and the pandemic. But, he said, hopefully, people will understand that the new variant shouldn’t be ignored and people will take proper precautions to stay safe.\n\n“We’re going to be dealing with COVID in one form or another going forward. I’m afraid that’s the sad reality,” he told WTVF-TV.\n\nHow to stay safe from omicron variant\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged all fully vaccinated Americans to get their COVID-19 boosters to help themselves stay safe from the new variant.\n\n“Today, CDC is strengthening its recommendation on booster doses for individuals who are 18 years and older,” said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the CDC director, in a statement. “Everyone ages 18 and older should get a booster shot either when they are six months after their initial Pfizer or Moderna series or 2 months after their initial J&J vaccine.”","reference1":"https://www.deseret.com/coronavirus/2021/11/30/22809801/omicron-variant-dangerous-explain-spike-protein-infection","reference2":"https://fortune.com/2021/12/02/gsk-who-jpmorgan-scientists-omicron-more-dangerous-other-covid-19-variants/","short_description":"Short

President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that Moscow would continue providing natural gas to Serbia on terms favorable to its ally.\n\nPutin voiced confidence that a new contract for gas supplies to Serbia would be signed quickly to replace the current one that expires at year-end.\n\n“We will find a solution that would definitely be acceptable to our Serbian friends,” Putin said at the start of talks at his Black Sea residence in Sochi with visiting Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic,\n\nPutin also noted that Russia would continue to staunchly support Serbia amid recent tensions with Kosovo.\n\n“We support your position on the Kosovo settlement, and I hope that the situation will eventually evolve in a way that would conform to the interests of all people living in the region,” he said.\n\nKosovo was a Serb province until a 1998-1999 insurrection by ethnic Albanian rebels sparked a bloody Serbian crackdown. That pushed NATO to carry out a 78-day bombing campaign to force Serbian troops out of Kosovo. The war left more than 10,000 people dead. Kosovo declared independence in 2008, but Serbia hasn’t recognized it. Kosovo-Serbia ties remain tense despite a European Union-facilitated dialogue over the past decade to normalize them.\n\nVucic hailed close ties between Serbia and Russia and particularly noted a high level in defense cooperation.\n\nAlthough formally seeking EU membership, Serbia has refused to align its foreign policies with the 27-nation bloc and has instead strengthened its alliance with Russia and China.","Media2_text":"Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić had a very unpleasant task when he met his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Sochi last week to plea for a lower price for Russian gas.\n\nIndeed, before travelling to Russia, President Vučić had told the Serbian press that he would \"ask and beg.\"\n\nIn the end, Putin fulfilled the request of his Serbian guest, meaning the Serbian president will have one less problem to worry about ahead of the April 2022 Serbian general election.\n\nHowever, the question remains as to whether there will be a price to be paid.\n\n**Serbia's gas supply on the line**\n\nWhy was this an unpleasant task for Vučić? Serbia is completely dependent on Russia for its gas supplies.\n\nIn 2008, Russia acquired majority shares in NIS, Serbia’s national oil and gas company. The sale was made below market price, in return for Russia’s protection at the UN level on Kosovo and the promise that Moscow would construct the now-defunct South Stream pipeline over Serbian territory. The opening of the Turkstream pipeline in 2021 confirmed the reality of energy dependence.\n\nHowever, in light of the ongoing energy crisis in Europe, Serbia now fears high Russian gas prices.\n\nIn 2022, Serbia is poised to undergo presidential and parliamentary elections, as well as elections in the capital, Belgrade.\n\nPresident Vučić and his Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) are almost certain to win. But both still face the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economy, which must not experience a major downturn until after they consolidate power.\n\nThe Serbian leadership needs to show that despite the pandemic, the economy is still growing. That was the primary reason why the government enthusiastically embraced Chinese financing, despite the ensuing degradation of environmental and labour standards.\n\nThe UAE is also useful as a source of cash and an instrument of domestic promotion. However, the high gas price would complicate things.\n\nThe first reason for Vučić’s concern was more immediate: the start of the cold season. High gas prices lead to higher costs for heating, electricity and groceries: all the things voters observe in the run-up to elections. In mid-November, high food and energy prices pushed the inflation rate to 6.6 per cent.\n\nSerbian pro-government daily Večernje novosti, despite being known for uncritical and hyperbolic praise of Serbian leadership and Serbo-Russian ties, gave an accurate overview of Serbia’s concern ahead of the Putin-Vučić meeting.\n\nSerbian gas consumption has doubled compared to previous years. Serbia has been paying Russia $270 (€239) per 1,000 cubic meters because, since the Soviet days, Serbia bought Russian gas based on a system whereby 100 per cent of the pricing is derived from the oil formula.\n\nIn light of the energy crisis, Russia’s state-owned energy corporation Gazprom proposed that price be determined 30 per cent by oil formula, 70 per cent by spot market prices, which would see Serbia newly charged $790 (€698) per 1,000 cubic meters.\n\n**Not such an easy task**\n\nThe Serbian head of state was hoping to secure a new arrangement, in which Serbia would be buying three billion cubic meters of Russian natural gas annually for ten years.\n\nPro-government media in Serbia flaunted the notion that Vučić could secure a fairer Russian gas price than countries like Germany, Belarus and Armenia had.\n\nThe difference was that Germany is a major customer of Russian gas, with a long-term supply contract, and Belarus and Armenia are Russia’s allies in the post-Soviet space.\n\nMore importantly, while Serbia insisted the focus would be on gas supply, Russia's presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that the two leaders would be discussing bilateral ties, with energy being just one of the issues that would be addressed.\n\nWhy is this important? For the past year, Serbia did a slight re-pivot towards Russia due to the election of Joe Biden in the US. However, 2020 was a very bad year for Serbo-Russian ties. Putin did not forget that.\n\nWhat happened in 2020? Putin did not like the idea that Vučić was trying to resolve the Kosovo dispute with Donald Trump’s assistance, which would mean Moscow would lose one of its last assets in the Balkans, and Belgrade's shifting towards Washington.\n\nTo curry favour with the West, pro-government tabloids in Serbia blamed pro-Russian players for instigating violent anti-lockdown protests in the summer of 2020.\n\nTrilateral military drills with Russia and Belarus were also cancelled. In the meantime, China replaced Russia as Serbia’s primary non-Western partner.\n\nPutin did not forget how Vučić tried to trick him when he thought he would get a better bargain from the West. The meeting was almost certainly used to discipline Vučić.\n\nNevertheless, Vučić got what he wanted. After the meeting, it was announced that the gas price for Serbia would remain at $270 and the amount of delivered gas would increase for the next six months.\n\nNo one knows what will happen after those six months end. But Vučić got a gift from Putin for the heating season -- and for the elections. Vučić can also promote himself to his constituents as a skillful leader who enjoys the friendship of brotherly Russia.\n\nWhat were the concessions offered?\nIt should be presumed, though, that Putin’s gift comes with strings attached.\n\nOn that same day, news started circulating that Russia’s state nuclear construction company Rosatom could be constructing a nuclear power plant in Serbia, although Serbian experts don't believe Serbia has the necessary expertise or resources for such an enterprise.\n\nRussian companies are also set to get the job of constructing the Belgrade urban and suburban railway system.\n\nMost importantly, there are talks that Serbia might be getting Kornet anti-tank missile systems from Russia: a dangerous scenario since in late 2019, Serbia, in fear of US sanctions, gave up on purchasing Russian weaponry.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether these transactions will be completed, and indeed whether any other favours that Vučić promised to Putin will be uncovered later in the game. After all, there's no such thing as a free

A first or second jab is of much greater benefit than a third one, protecting against serious illness, mortality and further transmission. Those outside the rich world are not being protected because of scarcity of supply. Their first or second jabs must have priority over our third.\n\nPoliticians may find this policy difficult, fearing critics who might accuse them of giving “our” benefit to foreigners. There is a simple solution. We should decline this third immunisation. I, a healthy pensioner who has had two doses, have refused the third jab, asking for it to be sent to those who will benefit more, and I invite others to do the same. This is not simply altruistic; limiting the extent of the pandemic is an advantage to all of us.\n\nChristopher Cheetham\nYatton, Somerset","Media2_text":"In response to Christopher Cheetham’s letter (21 September), I do not wish to disparage his sentiment of promoting the international availability of vaccines, but I must disagree with his proposed action. Refusing a Covid booster in the UK is not the way to increase the availability of vaccines in the world. Such action will only lead to wasted doses. Furthermore, an undervaccinated population will put an increasing strain on the NHS, and places our physically nearest and dearest at greater risk. Greater production of vaccines and their coordinated distribution internationally has to be a better answer.\n\nDr Stephen Mullin\nConsultant clinical neuropsychologist\n\n Declining a booster could lead to vaccines being wasted rather than sent overseas. I, and many others, would be happy to donate our boosters if tests showed we didn’t need it, according to research by Imperial College. Without this, my inclination is to have the booster to protect my own and others’ health, and reduce the demands on the NHS. Instead, people could donate to one of the organisations involved in Covax (for example, Unicef or Vaccinaid) and campaign for the government to do more. The petition here might be a start: .\n\nMarilyn Howard\nGloucester\n\n What about those of us who are extremely vulnerable? I still won’t leave the house alone except for medical appointments due to anxiety about contracting Covid. Although I have had both injections, I have been told I may not survive if I do contract it. So I will be accepting my booster, as some protection is better than none. I do not feel I am being selfish for trying to keep myself alive.\n\nTina Foster\nShipley, West

Today","media2_name":"Meduza","Media1_text":"The World Health Organization has warned blanket travel bans will not prevent the spread of Omicron, as more countries rushed to impose curbs and the first cases of the new Covid strain were detected in Latin America.\n\nIn the week since the new virus strain was reported by South Africa, dozens of countries around the world have responded with travel restrictions -- most targeting southern African nations.\n\nBut the World Health Organization warned Tuesday that \"blanket\" travel bans risked doing more harm than good, just as Canada expanded its restrictions.\n\nIn a travel advisory, the WHO warned the bans could ultimately dissuade countries from sharing data about the evolving virus.\n\nBut it did advise that unvaccinated people vulnerable to Covid-19, including over-60s, should avoid travel to areas with community transmission of the virus.\n\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was understandable for countries to seek to protect their citizens \"against a variant we don't yet fully understand\".\n\nBut he called for the global response to be \"calm, coordinated and coherent\", urging nations to \"take rational, proportional risk-reduction measures\".\n\nThe likely futility of broad travel restrictions was underscored as Dutch authorities reported that Omicron was present in the country before South Africa officially reported its first cases on November 25.\n\nThe new variant -- whose high number of mutations the WHO believes may make it more transmissible or resistant to vaccines -- was found in two Dutch test samples from November 19 and 23, with one having no travel history.\n\nSo far, well over a dozen countries and territories have detected cases, including Australia, Britain, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy and Portugal.\n\nLatin America reported its first two cases Tuesday -- in people who travelled from South Africa to Brazil -- and a first case was confirmed in Japan, one day after it barred all foreign arrivals.\n\nHowever, US President Joe Biden said the travel bans on just the southern African nations would stay in place, without referencing the other places where Omicron has been detected.\n\nAsked how long travel restrictions that took effect Monday on South Africa and seven other southern African countries would remain, Biden said it \"kind of depends\".\n\n\"We're going to learn a lot more in the next couple weeks about the lethality of this virus, about how much it spreads, what we have to control it, etcetera,\" he told reporters.\n\nAsked if any expansion of the travel restrictions to other countries could be made suddenly, as happened under former president Donald Trump, Biden said: \"Unlike Trump I don't shock our allies.\"\n\nIn Asia, governments continued Wednesday to expand restrictions, including with Indonesia adding Hong Kong to its travel ban list alongside various African nations.\n\nHong Kong also added three more countries – Japan, Portugal and Sweden -- to its highest travel restriction category after Omicron cases were discovered in those nations.\n\nVaccine-resistant? While much is still unknown about the Omicron variant -- it could take weeks to determine whether and to what extent it is vaccine-resistant -- it has highlighted that the global fight against Covid-19 is far from over.\n\nOmicron has emerged as much of the northern hemisphere was already bracing for a new winter wave of the pandemic -- leaving even nations with high vaccination rates struggling to contain rising infection numbers and prevent health services from being overwhelmed.\n\nGovernments, particularly in Western Europe, have already reintroduced mandatory mask-wearing, social-distancing measures, curfews or lockdowns -- leaving businesses fearing another grim Christmas.\n\nBritain has set a target of delivering third jabs to all adults within two months.\n\nWhile the European summer of fleeting Covid freedoms may be over, in the southern hemisphere, the Pacific island of Fiji ended 615 days of international isolation on Wednesday and reopened to tourists.\n\nTraditional dancers in grass skirts welcomed waving holidaymakers from Sydney, the first of an expected flood of desperately needed tourists in the coming weeks.\n\nFiji Airways chief executive Andre Viljoen said it was a \"momentous\" occasion, where tourism accounts for about 40 percent of the economy.\n\n\"The international border reopening will reignite Fiji's economy,\" he told reporters.","Media2_text":"Days after the new COVID-19 variant omicron was identified in South Africa, ever more countries are moving to close their borders to stem its spread. What travel restrictions are in place and can they be effective?\n\nB.1.1.529 is the scientific name of the new coronavirus variant discovered last week in South Africa. It has since been detected in several other countries, with Germany, Portugal, Great Britain, Israel and Canada, for instance, all reporting omicron infections.\n\nThere are fears that the new mutant could be even more contagious than the currently rampant delta variant and that vaccines may be less effective against it. As a result, many countries are trying to stem the further spread of omicron with travel curbs.\n\n**Europe **\n\nSince last week, travel between many European countries and southern Africa has been restricted. In Germany, for example, authorities deemed South Africa and seven other countries in the region — Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mozambique, Eswatini, Malawi and Lesotho — high-risk areas where the omicron virus variant is circulating. Airlines are only allowed to fly back German citizens and those residing in Germany from there. Both unvaccinated and vaccinated travelers coming from the region have to spend 14 days in quarantine regardless of whether they test negative for COVID-19.\n\nThe UK has resumed flight connections to South Africa after a temporary halt because of the omicron variant. However, South Africa and several neighboring countries are on a so-called red list. That means passengers returning from these countries face mandatory hotel quarantine for 10 days at their own expense.\n\nSwitzerland, too, has significantly tightened travel restrictions. Regular flights from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe have been suspended indefinitely. In addition, people entering the country from southern Africa, as well as from Hong Kong, Israel, Belgium, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Egypt, Malawi and other countries have to show a negative Corona test and spend 10 days in quarantine.\n\nAmerica\n\nUS President Joe Biden is under no illusion that the new variant can be stopped at borders.\n\n\"Sooner or later we are going to see new cases of this new variant here in the United States and we're going to have to face this new threat just as we have faced the ones that came before it,\" Biden said. Nevertheless, the US has also blocked entry for foreign nationals from southern African states in order to at least slow the virus' spread.\n\nIn neighboring Canada, where the first Omicron cases have already been detected, the government has imposed new travel curbs regarding South Africa, Eswatini, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Namibia. Only Canadian citizens from those countries and people with permanent residency in Canada can currently enter the country. They also have to comply with testing and quarantine regulations.\n\nBrazil has imposed a ban on flights from six southern African countries. Mexico's government, on the other hand, has ruled out new restrictions and border closures due to the discovery of the omicron variant. There is \"no evidence\" that the mutant is more dangerous and that vaccines are less effective against it, authorities said.\n\nAsia\n\nSeveral countries in Asia have also moved to curb the spread of omicron. Japan in the east and and Israel in the west, have implemented some of the toughest measures, with both closing borders to all foreigners, regardless of where they're coming from. Israeli travelers, for instance, have to isolate themselves for at least three days upon entry into the country whether they are vaccinated or unvaccinated, and no matter where they are arriving from. In addition, Israel is reintroducing a controversial measure that involves monitoring the mobile phones of those who fall ill.\n\nThe Philippines, which depends heavily on tourism, also plans to suspend measures to ease entry for vaccinated tourists because of the new virus variant. South Korea and Thailand are restricting flights from eight countries from December and those who have already entered the country have to immediately quarantine.\n\nOceania\n\nCanberra planned to allow foreign visitors with Australian visas to enter the country again from December 1, after access was severely restricted since May last year. But plans to relax entry rules have now been postponed for two weeks. The decision was made on the recommendation of health authorities after the first cases of omicron were also detected in Australia.\n\nAfrica\n\nA number of African countries, including Angola, Egypt, Mauritius and Rwanda, have also joined the ranks of countries that have imposed travel restrictions on South Africa and other nations on the continent.
